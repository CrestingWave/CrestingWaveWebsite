<h2 class="reveal">How Cresting Wave Works</h2>
<p>Technology discovery breaks down when context is ignored. Most solutions are presented without understanding your environment, priorities, or constraints, resulting in misaligned conversations and low-signal outcomes.</p>
<p style="margin:0; color:var(--text); font-weight:700;">We start with context.</p>
<p class="tagline">For technology leaders, we develop a clear understanding of priorities, environments, and constraints. For technology companies, we rigorously assess differentiation, use cases, and real-world applicability. Only then do we bring both sides together. Each introduction is intentional. Each conversation serves a purpose.</p>

<h2 class="reveal">For Technology Leaders</h2>
<p>You are accountable for strategy, architecture, and risk. We provide curated exposure to emerging technologies aligned with your priorities and operating environment, enabling informed discovery without irrelevant vendor conversations.</p>

<h2 class="reveal">Vetted Technologies</h2>
<p><strong>Cresting Wave is built on selectivity and precision.</strong> We do not surface technologies in bulk or by category. Every solution is evaluated through an operator-led process and matched to a technology leader’s specific environment, priorities, and constraints.</p><p>Our curation is informed by continuous dialogue with enterprise leaders and decades of hands-on experience, including the perspective of a former CTO of Blackstone. Engagements are designed to educate and inform, not persuade, bringing clarity where there is complexity and focus where there is excess.</p>

</div>
<div class="card reveal operator-led-card" style="grid-column: span 12;">
  <h2 class="reveal">Operator-Led by Design</h2>
  <p>Led by Steve Shuhet and Bill Murphy, Cresting Wave is built by operators who have played every role in the innovation go-to-market, from sales and entrepreneurship to investment and enterprise technology leadership. We exist to bring clarity and perspective to technology strategy.</p>
